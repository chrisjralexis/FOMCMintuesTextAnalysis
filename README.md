FOMC Minutes Sentiment Analysis

This code performs sentiment analysis on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. The FOMC is a committee within the U.S. Federal Reserve System responsible for making decisions about monetary policy. The sentiment analysis aims to determine whether the minutes express a hawkish (favoring higher interest rates) or dovish (favoring lower interest rates) sentiment, or if it is neutral.
